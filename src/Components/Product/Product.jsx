        Is built by a team of passionate automotive professionals with extensive
        CMVR Certification Process experience. We have worked on ICE vehicles as
        well as Electric Vehicle homologation starting from two-wheelers to
        commercial vehicles. We have exposure and experience in the end-to-end
        process of CMVR certification with all the testing agencies in India. We
        aim to make the application process of product certification as per the
        government rules and regulations much simpler and easier to handle by
        anyone with our software platform. With the growing scenario of the
        electric vehicle industry in India, there are large requirements for
        Homologation engineers for every EV-related start-up and company. Since
        the rise of EV segment, the industry has started realising the
        importance of the Homologation Engineer role for the new product
        certification &amp; FAME subsidy certification. Earlier with ICE
        vehicles and very few manufacturing players in the automotive sector,
        homologation engineers &amp; managers were very less. Awareness about
        the homologation process is very less even today in the society and
        market. But now, every company needs a homologation engineer.
        Unfortunately, there are very handful of homologation engineers in the
        industry. Thus we come into the picture to take up the role of
        homologation engineer and help companies in the CMVR certification
        process.

        software platform for the CMVR Certification process in India. It will
        reduce preparation and documentation time without any dependency. We aim
        to bring awareness of the product with a visual representation of the
